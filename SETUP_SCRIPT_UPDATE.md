# Setup Script Update - Interactive Backup Restoration

## 🎉 **Enhanced Setup Script**

The `setup-dynamic-images.js` script has been upgraded with **interactive backup restoration** capabilities, making it much more user-friendly and safer.

## 🆕 **New Features**

### **Interactive Setup Process**
- **Automatic backup detection** - Scans for existing backups
- **User choice** - Offers to restore from backup or create new configuration
- **Smart behavior** - Adapts based on existing files and backups
- **Safe operations** - No data loss, always provides options

### **Three Setup Scenarios**

#### **1. Fresh Installation (No Config, No Backups)**
```
🚀 Setting up Dynamic Image Management System...

ℹ️  No backups found, creating initial configuration...
✅ Created initial dynamic-images.json configuration
   - Added sample PIXEL 8 and FOLD 5 configurations
```

#### **2. Fresh Installation with Existing Backups**
```
🚀 Setting up Dynamic Image Management System...

📦 Found 2 backup(s) available

🔍 Would you like to restore from a backup? (y/n): y

📋 Available backups:
   1. dynamic-images-2025-08-18T02-32-08-005Z.json (2.1KB, 8/17/2025, 9:32:08 PM)
   2. dynamic-images-2025-08-18T02-28-32-994Z.json (928 bytes, 8/17/2025, 9:28:32 PM)
   3. Create new initial configuration
   4. Exit setup

🔍 Select an option (enter number): 1
```

#### **3. Existing Configuration with Backups**
```
🚀 Setting up Dynamic Image Management System...

ℹ️  dynamic-images.json already exists
📦 Found 1 backup(s) available

🔍 Would you like to check for backups and restore from one? (y/n): y
```

- **Numbered menu** for backup selection
- **Clear options** including "Create new" and "Exit"
- **Error handling** for invalid inputs

### **Restoration Process**

- Shows restoration statistics
- Provides clear success/failure feedback
- Maintains data safety

## 📋 **Setup Options**

### **Available Choices**
1. **Restore from specific backup** - Select by number
2. **Create new initial configuration** - Fresh start with sample data
3. **Exit setup** - Cancel operation
4. **Keep existing configuration** - No changes

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

## 🔄 **Integration with Other Scripts**

### **Works with Backup System**

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **For New Installations**
1. Run `npm run setup-images`
2. Check for existing backups
3. Restore from backup if available
4. Create new config only if needed

### **For Existing Systems**
1. Run `npm run setup-images` to check backups
2. Restore from backup if configuration is corrupted
3. Use as alternative to manual restore process

### **For Development**
1. Use setup script for fresh environments
2. Restore from backups for consistent testing
3. Create new configs for isolated testing

## 📞 **Support**

If setup script encounters issues:
1. Check console output for error messages
2. Verify backup file integrity manually
3. Use `npm run restore-images` as alternative
4. Check file permissions and disk space

**The enhanced setup script provides a much safer and more user-friendly initialization process!** 🎉
