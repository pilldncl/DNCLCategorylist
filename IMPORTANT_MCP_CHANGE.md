# IMPORTANT: MCP Configuration Changed

## ✅ What Changed

Your MCP Supabase server is now connected to the **correct** Supabase project (`tvzcqwdnsyqjglmwklkk` instead of `uuvgdqxmptkvnwpztecv`).

## 🔄 Action Required

**You MUST restart Cursor for this change to take effect!**

1. Close Cursor completely (don't just reload)
2. Reopen Cursor
3. The MCP Supabase server will now connect to your correct project

## 📝 Next Steps After Restart

Once you've restarted Cursor, I can:
1. Create the `banners` and `featured_products` tables in the correct Supabase project
2. Insert your banner data
3. Test the admin interface

## ⚠️ Note

I updated the Supabase MCP URL in `c:\Users\phuly\.cursor\mcp.json`.
The Postgres MCP line still points to the old project, but we don't need that for now.
